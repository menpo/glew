This is just a copy of the GLEW source married together with a CMAKE file that I found in the OpenChemistry repository. That repository is BSD and the license is maintained in ``OPENCHEMISTRY_LICENSE.txt``.

GLEW is also BSD, it's license is maintained in ``GLEW_LICENSE.txt``.

I have edited the OpenChemistry CMakeLists in order to remove the info executables because I do not need them. If necessary, you are free to make a pull request that re-adds building them.
